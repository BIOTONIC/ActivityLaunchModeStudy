# Android Homework Two
In this task, I create a simple application to study the differences between two intents(explicit intent and implicit intent) and four activity launch modes(standard, singletop, singletask and singleinstance)

## MainActivity

There are five buttons in MainActivty:
- Click first button to open a website by an implicit intent.

- Click other buttons to start activities in different launch modes.
  Noticed that only the standard mode activity is started by implicit intent, other three acticities are all started by explicit intent, you can see the difference in the code.
